**Platform:** ROS (Robot Operating System) / C++

### Project Overview and Repository Structure
This repository hosts the source code and engineering environment for my Bachelor's graduation project, which focuses on the development of an autonomous control system for quadcopters. To facilitate both code review and deployment, the repository is organized into two distinct branches. The **`main` branch** is streamlined to highlight the core algorithmic contributions; it isolates the essential C++ source files recently updated for the control logic and sensor fusion modules, allowing reviewers to inspect the implementation details without navigating through build artifacts. Conversely, the **`master` branch** serves as a complete snapshot of the runtime environment. It preserves the full ROS Catkin workspace structure—including `src`, `build`, and `devel` directories—to ensure that the specific compilation environment and dependency configurations can be exactly reproduced on a physical Linux machine.

### Technical Implementation Details
The core logic residing in this project implements a modular architecture dividing perception, state estimation, and flight control. The `rtk_convert.cpp` module acts as the driver layer, responsible for parsing high-precision GNSS differential data and converting geodetic coordinates into a local NED (North-East-Down) frame for navigation. This position data is fused with IMU acceleration readings within `cuadc_odom.cpp`, which utilizes filtration algorithms to provide stable odometry and minimize drift during flight. The system's behavior is orchestrated by `cuadc_node.cpp` and `cuadc_takeoff.cpp`, which implement a finite state machine managing the complete flight lifecycle—from safety checks and arming to autonomous takeoff and mission execution—demonstrating the practical application of the control theories explored in my thesis.

### Deployment Instructions
For users intending to compile or deploy the system, please switch to the **`master` branch**. This branch contains the necessary CMake configurations and the pre-generated build environment compatible with ROS Noetic. To deploy, simply clone the `master` branch into your local environment and execute `catkin_make` at the workspace root. This will generate the executable nodes and link the libraries required to communicate with the flight controller hardware and onboard sensors.
